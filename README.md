# ext_int0_isr
This code is still in experimental use for analog which I tried in SDR for air band reception "They told me I've crossed the line )
I downloaded CV/AVR coding app from www.getintopc.com and ran the program using the wizard. I kinda new what I was doing and hope this file comes in handy use or futher use for anyone needing to get out of their same old box and reach for the stars.
